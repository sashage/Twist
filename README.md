## Set Up your Shadowsocks-libev Server
Please **Run Command** below on your server to **Install Twist**
```bash
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hybtoy/Twist/master/twist -O twist.sh && chmod -x twist.sh && bash twist.sh
```

## Attention
Please make sure that your server was able to **Connect to the Internet and Opened these Inboard & Outboard Ports** below. It required by shadowsocks-libev services based on your configurations. And It will be automatically configured on your System Side but will not be on the Server Management Console
```txt
UDP 443
TCP 443
```

## Custom
Change the default configurations by editing Twish before install, the manual and detailed information of shadowsocks-libev configurations is at <a href="https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks/wiki/Configuration-via-Config-File" target="_blank">shadowsocks-libev Wiki</a>
```bash
sudo nano twist.sh       # Edit the value below on 'function *config'
```
If you have already installed Twist, try this by editing raw config file that installed on your server instead of the install script 
```bash
sudo twist custom  # Edit the value in json format
```
Edit values in typename="**HERE**", save and run Twist after you have confirmed that it is correct
```txt
 PORT="443"                       # Server port
 LOACL="127.0.0.1"                # The address that server listens
 LOCALPORT="1080"                 # Local port of loacl address that server listens
 PASSWORD=""                      # Password used for encryption, auto generate if left free 
 DNS="8.8.8.8"                    # Default DNS server address of Google Public DNS
 TIMEOUT="600"                    # Drop connections if it not using in seconds
 METHOD="xchacha20-ietf-poly1305" # Encryption, AEAD is better than OTA
 OBFS="tls"                       # Obfs method using tls or http
 OBFSHOST="google.com"            # Obfs host address
 OBFSURI="/"                      # Obfs specify the client request path uri
 BBR="enable"                     # Google BBR for low delay network to get faster speed
 FWS="enable"                     # Fake as a apache web server for concealing
 ABB="enable"                     # Uses Fail2ban to ban force crackers
```

## Encrypt Method Cipher
- There are some **recommend AEAD Ciphers** to use if the default cipher is not available for the clients on your device
```txt
aes-128-gcm
aes-192-gcm
aes-256-gcm
chacha20-ietf-poly1305
xchacha20-ietf-poly1305
```
- Also the Stream Ciphers listed here, which are not recommend. If there is no other choice, please try these
```txt
rc4
rc4-md5
rc2-cfb
bf-cfb
des-cfb
idea-cfb
seed-cfb
cast5-cfb
camellia-128-cfb
camellia-192-cfb
camellia-256-cfb
aes-128-cfb
aes-192-cfb
aes-256-cfb
aes-128-ctr
aes-192-ctr
aes-256-ctr
salsa20
chacha20
chacha20-ietf
```

## Simple Obfs
Here is the deafult configurations of simple-obfs, it will not be run without configure it on your clients side. And you could use shadowsocks without set up simple-obfs on your clients. If you used the URLSchemes or QRCode to setup your clients, simple-obfs may not be configured in some old clients or third-part clients
```txt
OBFS="tls"
OBFSHOST="mzstatic.com"
OBFSURI="/"
```

## Check and Change Shadowsocks-libev Status
- Check if shadowsocks-libev is running on your server
```bash
twist status        # Check Shadowsocks Status
```
- Change the status of shadowsocks-libev by these commands
```bash
sudo twist start    # Start Shadowsocks Service
sudo twist stop     # Stop Shadowsocks Service
sudo twist restart  # Restart Shadowsocks Service
```

## Setup Shadowsocks-libev to Connect to the Server on your Devices
It requires shadowsocks based clients on your device and you may have to manually set up some features or you can use the URLScheme and QRCode for configuration. Be careful and make sure there is a simple-obfs plugin on your client side if you used this feature. Otherwise, if the default cipher is not available on your clients, try other cipher I have mentioned yet. Don't dismiss any useful information for troubleshooting

## Update Twist
Please **Run Command** to update Twist
```bash
sudo twist update
```
You can also update Twist automaticly by using ```crond``` Service
```bash
echo "0 0 1 * * root bash /usr/bin/twist update" >> /etc/crontab
```
The commands means **Twist will automaticly check updates on the first day of every month**
